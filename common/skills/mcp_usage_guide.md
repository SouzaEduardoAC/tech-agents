# Skill: MCP Usage Guide — Agent Hub Server

## Purpose
A foundational reference skill that teaches any LLM how to interact with the Agent Hub MCP server (`@souzaeduardoac/ai-agents`). This guide covers all exposed tools, the full agent catalog, command aliases, and a decision flowchart for selecting the right agent. It should be treated as required reading before making any MCP tool call.

---

## 1. Overview

The Agent Hub MCP server exposes **7 tools** for agent discovery, command execution, prompt retrieval, and pipeline management. The package is `@souzaeduardoac/ai-agents`.

**Core principle:** When you call `call_agent_command`, the returned prompt **IS** the agent. You must adopt its persona, follow its instructions, and execute its task. It is not informational — it is an identity transfer.

---

## 2. MCP Tools Reference

### Tool 1: `list_agents`

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Parameters | None |
| Returns | All available agents and their registered commands |
| When to use | Call this **FIRST** when unsure which agent or command to use. This is the discovery tool. |

---

### Tool 2: `call_agent_command`

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Parameters | `agent` (string), `command` (string), `args` (string) |
| Returns | The fully assembled agent prompt with persona, skills, and knowledge |
| When to use | When the user explicitly requests an agent, or when the task naturally maps to a specialized domain |

**Key behaviors:**
- The returned prompt IS the agent — adopt its persona and execute its instructions.
- Command aliases exist (e.g., `run` for squad maps to the actual command). The MCP handles alias resolution automatically.
- The `args` parameter should contain the full task description — be specific, as it becomes the agent's primary objective.

---

### Tool 3: `get_agent_prompt`

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Parameters | `agent` (string) |
| Returns | The full identity, persona, and knowledge base for an agent WITHOUT executing a command |
| When to use | To preview or understand an agent's capabilities before committing to a command |

---

### Tool 4: `pipeline_start`

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Parameters | `goal` (string), `gates` (array of strings) |
| Returns | Session ID, confirmation, and registered gates |
| When to use | Only at the beginning of a Squad `run` pipeline |

Creates a `.squad-state.json` file with all gates set to `locked`. Must be called before `request_approval` or `check_gate`.

---

### Tool 5: `request_approval`

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Parameters | `gate` (string), `artifact_path` (optional string), `summary` (string) |
| Returns | A hard STOP message |
| When to use | After completing a pipeline phase. Only within Squad pipelines. |

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** This is a **HARD STOP**. Do NOT call any further agent tools or continue pipeline work after this tool returns. Wait for human approval.

---

### Tool 6: `check_gate`

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Parameters | `gate` (string) |
| Returns | Approval status (approved/pending/locked) |
| When to use | At the **START** of each new pipeline phase, before doing any work |

Returns `approved: true` if the gate has been approved. Returns an error if the gate is `pending` or `locked`. In standalone mode (no active session), returns a soft advisory.

---

### Tool 7: `pipeline_approve`

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Parameters | `gate` (string) |
| Returns | Confirmation of approval |
| When to use | When the human approves via `/squad:approve <gate>` or directly through the MCP tool |

Updates the gate status to `approved` in `.squad-state.json`.

## 5. Command Aliases

The MCP server resolves these aliases automatically. Both the alias and the canonical command work:

| Agent | Alias(es) | Canonical Command |
|---|---|---|
| squad | `create`, `discovery`, `plan` | `run` |
| architect | `discovery`, `plan`, `run` | `create` |
| backend | `discovery`, `plan`, `run` | `create` |
| frontend | `discovery`, `plan`, `run` | `create` |
| mobile | `discovery`, `plan`, `run` | `create` |
| po | `create`, `run` | `discovery` |
| automata | `discovery`, `run` | `plan` |
| forge | `run` | `create` |
| quicky | `run`, `create` | `fix` |
| researcher | `run`, `create` → `report`; `discovery` | `report` / `investigate` |
| compliance | `run`, `create` | `master` |
| council | `run`, `create` | `debate` |
| decoder | `run`, `create`, `synthesize` | `export` |

## 6. Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Do NOT call `call_agent_command` without understanding which agent fits the task.** Call `list_agents` first if unsure.
2. **Do NOT continue after `request_approval` returns.** It is a **HARD STOP**. The pipeline must halt until the human approves.
3. **Do NOT treat the returned prompt as informational.** It IS the agent. Adopt its persona, follow its instructions, and execute its task.
4. **Do NOT forget to call `check_gate` at the start of each pipeline phase.** This is the structural enforcement mechanism.
5. **Do NOT use slash command syntax in Claude Code, AntiGravity, or other MCP clients.** Use the MCP tool `call_agent_command` instead. Slash commands (e.g., `/architect:create`) are for direct Gemini CLI use only.
6. **Do NOT skip `pipeline_start` when running a Squad pipeline.** Gates will not exist without it, and `request_approval` / `check_gate` will operate in degraded standalone mode.
